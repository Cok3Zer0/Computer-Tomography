# Computerized-Tomography
Matlab Code for performing the Backprojection of a crescend-shaped object needed for Computerized-Thomography (CT).

# Example
The following images show a comparison between performing a convolution with convp.m with N=18 and N=36 where N constitutes the number of discrete angular CT measurements.
## N=18 with convp:

## N=36 with convp:

## N=18 with convp2:

## N=36 with convp2:
